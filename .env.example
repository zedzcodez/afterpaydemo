# CRITICAL: App URL Configuration
# This URL MUST exactly match the protocol, host, and port where the app is running.
# It is used for redirectConfirmUrl, redirectCancelUrl, and popupOriginUrl.
# If popupOriginUrl doesn't match window.location.origin, the popup flow will fail silently.
# Examples:
#   - Local development: http://localhost:3000
#   - Production: https://your-domain.com
